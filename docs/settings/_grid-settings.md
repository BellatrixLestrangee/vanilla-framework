Vanilla's default grid has 12 columns and 20px gutters. On large screens, each column takes up 6.3053% of the total width.

Setting  | Default value
 ------------- | -------------
`$grid-gutter-widths`   | 20px
`$grid-columns`   | 12
`$grid-max-width`   | 1030px

Layouts can be created combining rows with different number of columns to an ideal maximum of 4 columns per row. Each column should span a minimum of 3 column units.
