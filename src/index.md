## A simple extensible CSS framework, written in Sass.

Vanilla Framework contains a basic CSS grid and pattern classes, and is
designed to be extended either directly or by creating extension themes.

Sites created within Canonical should follow this style guide closely,
whereas external sites are free to adapt and expand the existing components to
their needs.

For ways to use Vanilla framework, see the <a href="https://github.com/ubuntudesign/vanilla-framework">Github project.</a>
