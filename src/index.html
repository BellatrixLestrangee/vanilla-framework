<h1>Vanilla framework</h1>

<h2>A simple extensible CSS framework, written in Sass.</h2>

<p>Vanilla Framework contains a basic CSS grid and pattern classes, and is
designed to be extended either directly or by creating extension themes.</p>

<p>Sites created within Canonical should follow this style guide closely,
whereas external sites are free to adapt and expand the existing components to
their needs.</p>

<p>For ways to use Vanilla framework, see the <a href="https://github.com/ubuntudesign/vanilla-framework">Github project.</a></p>
